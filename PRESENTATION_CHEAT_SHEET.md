## 💡 Wow Moments to Highlight

1. **"Watch this magic"** - Ask Coder about auth, then ask Artist to visualize it. Artist auto-generates diagram using Coder's context!

2. **"No repetition needed"** - Ask Tutor to explain. It already knows what Coder discussed AND what Artist drew.

3. **"Everything persists"** - Refresh page. Everything still there. Switch workspaces. Independent contexts.

4. **"Award-level polish"** - Show Plasma WebGL background and TrueFocus animation on landing page.

5. **"Production-ready"** - Real PostgreSQL database, bcrypt security, type-safe TypeScript, ready to deploy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Impressive Points)

**Frontend:**
- React 18 + TypeScript (full type safety)
- TanStack Query (efficient caching)
- Framer Motion (TrueFocus animation)
- OGL (custom WebGL Plasma shader)

**Backend:**
- Express + TypeScript (RESTful API)
- Drizzle ORM (type-safe queries)
- bcrypt (password security)

**Database:**
- Neon PostgreSQL (serverless, autoscaling)
- Relational design with CASCADE DELETE

**AI:**
- OpenRouter API (model flexibility)
- openai/gpt-4o-mini (cost-effective)
- Context assembly system

**Total:** 5,650+ lines of production code

## 📊 Cross-Panel Sync (Core Innovation)

```
User asks Coder: "Build auth system"
    ↓
Coder AI responds with code
    ↓
Messages saved to PostgreSQL
    ↓
User asks Artist: "Visualize this"
    ↓
Artist fetches Coder context
    ↓
Auto-generates Mermaid diagram
    ↓
User asks Tutor: "Explain to beginner"
    ↓
Tutor fetches:
  - Last 5 Coder messages
  - Last 3 Artist diagrams
    ↓
Comprehensive learning response
```

**Key Benefit:** AI agents enhance each other!
