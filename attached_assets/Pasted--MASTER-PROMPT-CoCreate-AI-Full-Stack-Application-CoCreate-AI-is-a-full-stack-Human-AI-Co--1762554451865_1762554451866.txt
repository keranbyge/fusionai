🧠 MASTER PROMPT — “CoCreate AI: Full-Stack Application”

CoCreate AI is a full-stack Human + AI Co-Creation Platform where users collaborate with AI for coding, creative art, and adaptive tutoring.
The platform integrates frontend, backend, database, and AI memory, is deployable, and completely free to use.

🌐 Overall Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Flask (Python)

Database: SQLite3 (users, workspaces, chat memory)

AI Engine: OpenRouter API (free key)

Voice System: SpeechRecognition (input) + gTTS (output)

Diagram Rendering: Mermaid.js (frontend) + PlantUML/Graphviz (backend)

Auth: Flask-JWT or Flask-Login

API Style: REST (/api/*)

🚀 Functional Overview
1️⃣ Landing + Authentication

Landing page with title “CoCreate AI – Build with AI, not just for AI”

Sign In / Sign Up options

After login, user is redirected to Create Workspace page

2️⃣ Workspace Dashboard

Sidebar: lists user’s workspaces and “+ New Workspace” option

Main Area: divided into three resizable panels — Coder, Artist, and Tutor

Each panel includes Minimize / Maximize / Close controls

Layout and state are preserved per workspace

3️⃣ Coder Tab

Interactive chat interface for coding assistance

Accepts both text and voice input

AI adapts to the user’s coding style using stored history

4️⃣ Artist Tab

AI-powered visual workspace

Converts user prompts or code into flowcharts, wireframes, or mind maps

Uses Mermaid.js for live diagram rendering

5️⃣ Tutor Tab

Conversational learning assistant

Provides contextual learning by referencing user’s Coder and Artist interactions

Offers both text and voice replies

6️⃣ Voice System

Real-time Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech conversion

Voice input for prompts and audio playback for responses

7️⃣ Memory & Persistence

Every chat or diagram is stored in a SQLite database per workspace and tab

Each workspace maintains context-aware AI memory

On reload, workspace history and AI context are automatically restored

🧱 Core Modules

Authentication: Secure login, signup, and token management

Workspaces: Creation, listing, and persistent memory storage

AI Interaction: Routes for coder, artist, and tutor responses

Voice Processing: Converts between text and speech seamlessly

Visualization: Diagram generation from natural language or code

🧩 Expected End Result

Smooth user flow: Landing → Auth → Workspace Creation

Sidebar for workspace management

Three intelligent, resizable panels (Coder, Artist, Tutor) working in parallel

Persistent AI memory and adaptive context understanding

Fully functional, free-to-deploy app on platforms like Replit
